  "acknowledgements":
  Ian  Witten  deserves  the  foremost  mention  in  these  acknowledgements
,  because
  without  him  this  PhD  would  not  have  been  possible.  Nearly  five  years  ago  I  came
  to  the  University  of  Waikato
  as
  a  Ukrainian
  /German
  exchange
  student  with  an
  unprono
  unceable  name  and  a  poor  knowledge  of
  English
  .  Like  with  many  other
  students,  Ian  ha
  s  been  a  patient,  encouraging  and  supporting  teacher,  who
  helped
  me to
  bring
  out the best possible of my potential.
  Ian, I consider myself extremely lucky to have been inv
  ited to come back for a
  PhD  with  you.  The  last  three  years
  have  shaped  me
  into  who  I  am  and  opened
  many  new  opportunities
  for  my  future  life.  Thanks
  for  teaching
  me  to  be
  patient
  and focused in the research, for encouraging
  the
  highly rewarding voluntary w
  ork
  and  for
  your  continuous  support  in
  deal
  ing
  with  difficulties  in
  professional
  and
  personal  life.  Thank  you  and  Pam  for  inviting  us  to  parties  and  dinners  at  your
  place,  for  organizing  the  wonderful  Waiheke  holiday  and  for  letting  me  stay  in
  your
  house
  in the last weeks of my PhD.
  Please remember that you have a free life
  subscription to fire performances and yoga lessons.
  I  would  also  like  to  thank  my  other  supervisor  Eibe  Frank,  who  was  always
  promptly available for help whenever I knocked on his door.
  Thank you, Eibe, for
  sharing  your  machine  learning  expertise  and  for  developing  the  Kea  algorithm,
  which provided a great basis for Maui’s architecture.
  I  am  very  proud  to  have  been  a  part  of  the  multi
  -cultu
  ral  group  of  Ian’s  PhD
  students  and  to  have  coll
  aborated  with  other  Waikato  researchers  like  Cathy  Legg
  and  Gian  Perrone
  .  Thank
  you,  girls  and  guys,
  for  listening  to  my  progress,  for
  helping with practicing presentations
  and interviews
, and for your great company.
  I look forward to staying in touch and
  hearing about your future successes!
  I  would  like  to  thank
  Google  for
  offering
  the
  scholarship  for  my  PhD
  and  one
  of  their  employees  and  Ian’s  former  student,
  Craig  Nevill
  -Manning
,  for  helping
  me with organizing
  the
  extremely valuable internship at Google
  New York. Craig,
  thanks
  also for providing the best possible
  motiv
  ation
  with
  your
  post
  -PhD success
  and for staying in touch with us, Waikato students, as an unofficial mentor
  .
  Knowing  that  other  people  work  on  similar  problems  has  been  incredibly
  motivatin
  g.  Through  conference  trips
  —
  sponsored  by  Google
  and
  BuildIT
  —
  I  met
  many  talented  researchers
  who
  influenced
  my  work
  .  Thank
  s  to
  Michael  Poprat,
  Alberto Pepe
, Andras Csomai
  for exchanging
  ideas
, and to
  Dmitry Lizorkin
, Alan
  Aronson
  and
  Annette
  Holtkamp for
  sharing their data sets and results with me.
  Since I
  am not a native speaker, proof
  reading help from friends and colleagues
  was needed
  . Ian
  once noted
  that
  I use
  exactly the right amount
  of “a”s and “the”s,
  but  all  in
  the
  wrong  places.
  My
  knowledgeable  and  experience
  d  proof
  readers
  helped
  not  only
  with  grammar,  but  also
  with
  the  organization  and  clarity  of  th
  is
  thesis. A huge thanks to Anna Huang
, Craig
  Schock,
  Dav
  id Milne, Gian Perrone
,
  James  Gorman
,  Kathryn  Hempstalk,
  Kerry  Hannan
,  Nathan  Holmberg
,  Rob
  Akscyn,
  Shaoqun Wu
, Tom Manschreck, and
  Tudor Leu
  .
  I have been lucky to
  do
  my PhD at the same time as Dav
  id Milne, whose name
  frequently  re
  -occurs  in  this  thesis  because  our
  topic
  s  were
  clo
  sely  related.  Several
  parts   of   this
  thesis
  (e.g.
,   Section
  s   4.2.1   and
  5.1.2)
  are
  the
  result   of   our
  collaboration. Although at times
  dissecting the topics we shared into two PhDs
  has
  been  difficult,
  the  benefits  were  greater
  .  Thank  you,  Dave,  for  being  a  val
  uable
  discussion partner
, a patient co
  -author, and for building the Wikipedia Miner, the
  coolest tool on
  Source
  Forge.
  Also, t
  hank you for being a great
  friend
  .
  I  also  want  to  thank  the  many  other
  friends
  around  the  world  who
  made  the
  past years
  into
  a spe
  cial and
  unforgettable time.
  Without committing to this PhD
  I wouldn’t have met
  Nathan, who
, as it happens,
  gave me the reason to finish
  it on
  time
  . Thank you so much for all the support and wonderful distractions of the last
  months.
  Finally,  a  huge  thanks
  to  my  parents  who  have  taught  me  the  value  of  a  good
  education.  Thanks  to  them  I  was  the  first  person  in  the  class  to  own  a  computer,
  which  eventually  lead  to  doing  a  PhD  in  Computer  Science.  I  guess  I  should  be
  careful  with  what  to  buy  for  my  children  on
  e  day.  M
  um,  you  have  been  the
  driving force behind my career and my dearest friend. I love you and dedicate this
  work to you.
